# House Price Predictions
Using an ensemble model to predict house prices, final performance is within the top 200 on the leaderboard.
Pycaret was used to give an idea as to how certain models perform before tuning, allowing us to select the models that are most likely to perform well.
Oputna was then used to automatically find hyperparameters for the 5 models used. 
There is likely room to improve, feature engineering could improve performance.
